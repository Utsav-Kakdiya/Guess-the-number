# Guess-the-number

This is a simple and basic interactive 'Guess the Number' web game built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.The game prompts the player to guess a random number within a given range. I created it to strengthen my core JavaScript skills, specifically focusing on DOM manipulation to update the UI, event handling to manage user inputs, and applying basic game logic to control the flow of the game.
